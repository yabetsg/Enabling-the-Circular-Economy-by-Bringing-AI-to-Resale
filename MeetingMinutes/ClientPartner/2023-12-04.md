## Feedback
* Iteration 2
* Where should search bar go on products page?
  * Make it very obvious that clothing can be searched for
    * Common question from potential users is if they can search through clothing
  * Searching should take place after style profile
    * Should not be able to see any inventory until you fill out style profile
* Normal ecommerce website
  * Edit account overview layout
    * No longer going to be "building your order"
      * No longer going to build a box
    * User will fill out style profile, search through recommended clothing, and checkout
* Functionality
  * Anna - Happy with the clothing search features
  * Jeff - Happy with the progress made since last iteration
