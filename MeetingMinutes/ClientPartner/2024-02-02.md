    * Going to send Anna Figma files for her feedback for minor things to change
  * Add to cart feature needs to take user to Goodwill's website to purchase item

  * Take off background of images so that items look nicer if possible

* Plans for 4th Iteration
  * Point system for style questions
    * Points added based on what items user clicks on to add more personalized experience
  * Nuance for style questions

  * General information for their backend on how to connect to specific inventory system

* Anna wanted feedback on Goodwill's inventory
  * Considering trying to bring on other vendors to expand "good" items available
  * Wants to make users able to become "pro-thrifters" instead of having to dig through good & bad items to find what they want

## Things Clarified
* 4th Iteration - Anna wants us to focus on the algorithm
  * Important for fundraising and adding new vendors
* Front-end work is basically complete for this project
