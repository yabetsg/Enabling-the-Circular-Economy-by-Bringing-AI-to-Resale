## Topics Discussed
* 3rd Iteration
  * Current scoring system
    * Feedback: Allow for nuance
      * Example: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the color red?
      
* 4th Iteration
  * User profile will have weights for each attribute
  * Attribute to each user in database that adds point value based on what they click
  * Point system for style quiz
  * Switching over to MongoDB
    * Feedback: Since we're using Prisma already, data is already abstracted. Will make things easier

* Cart System Issues
  * What is wrong?
    * The API call sends 200 items to the cart instead of what the user clicks on.
    * Will add what user clicks on, but still has the original first 200 items
  * What needs done?
    * Filtered user data needed to be called instead

## Things Clarified
* 4th iteration will have more concrete changes
* Fleece
