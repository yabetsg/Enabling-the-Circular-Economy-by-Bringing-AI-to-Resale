## Topics Discussed
* Briefly went over notes from client meeting from 9/28/2023
* Went over the amount of experience everyone has with AWS. Austen has the most experience with it.
* Jeff informed us that we would be able to just hardcode a database to use as a sample while working on the front-end.
Discussed how that would end up working out and the difficulty of it
* We need to clarify what Jeff envisions when he references machine learning and AI. We believe that what he wants and what he needs are two different things.
We will need to clarify this during the next client meeting
* Discussed how we would make a responsive design with different devices, some screen sizes may need to be hard coded
* No tasks were created at this time

## Things Clarified
* Available times for next client meeting, at this point we are considering October 2nd
* Need to clarify with Jeff the type of machine learning/AI and need more information about the company's domain
