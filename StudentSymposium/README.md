## Experiences

### Ameco Smith
#### The student symposium was definitely fulfilling overall. I had the opportunity to try another teams capstone, specifically the game design one and it was very fun! It felt really good/rewarding to display the project to other people and just simply answer questions about it. Especially after working on it for two semesters.

### Austen Lowder
#### I had a really good time at the symposium. I spoke to a lot of people one of them was named Luke. His study was about fly brains and how their serotonin auto receptors work; How they affect a maggot's growth. Fly brains look like a penis, fun fact. I also talked to Kate Swoope, whose study was on the electrical conductivity of DNA and how it could be used to make better faster computers with less electrical leak along with particular accelerators using DNA as its conductive material instead of copper for a better solution.

### Brennan Hincks
#### During the symposium I had an interesting time as I was the person in charge of speaking to the judges about our project. I spoke to 4 judges about what we worked on, only one of them was alone and the other three were together all at the same time. Unfortunately for me during this time my team had decided then was the best time to leave and go investigate other projects. It was an unfortunate occurrence as when they came back they told me that they didn't mean to and didn't see that the people I was talking to were judges and that they wouldn't have left if they knew. I was not and am not mad. I had some fun discussing projects with the other teams in close proximity and met some interesting people who were not in our field. 

### Haley Blanton
#### I enjoyed going to and participating in the symposium. I thought that it was interesting to see all the projects that were going on throughout the different majors. It was exciting to be able to present our project to multiple people after all of these months of working on it, especially since they seemed genuinely interested in using the software once it launches in the Fall.

#### Dude, hitting up the Student Symposium was legit! Got to vibe with all sorts of dope projects. Linked up with Johnny, this cat was all about hooking up rural areas with renewable energy, super cool stuff. We bounced ideas back and forth, and I even dropped some knowledge on our project vibe. Missed out on the formal presentation scene, but the Symposium was prime for networking and swapping know-how. Left feeling totally pumped by the mad skills and passion of my fellow students.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™
