#### I had a really good time at the symposium. I spoke to a lot of people one of them was named Luke. His study was about fly brains and how their serotonin autoreceptors work; How they affect a maggots growth. Fly brains look like penis's fun fact. I also talked to Kate swoope, who's study was on the electrical conductivitiy of DNA and how it could be used to make better faster computers with less electrical leak along with partical accelators using DNA as its conductive material instead of copper for a better solution.

### Brennan Hincks
#### During the symposium I had an interesting time as I was the person in charge of speaking to the judges about our project. I spoke to 4 judges about what we worked on, only one of them was alone and the other three were together all at the same time. Unfortunately for me during this time my team had decided then was the best time to leave and go investigate other projects. It was an unfortunate occurance as when they came back they told me that they didn't mean to and didn't see that the people I was talking to were judges and that they wouldn't have left if they knew. I was not and am not  I had some fun discussing projects with the other teams in close proximity and met some interesting people who were not in our field.
